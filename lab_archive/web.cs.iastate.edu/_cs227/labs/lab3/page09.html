<h2>The Rabbit Problem</h2>

<p>
You are working with a team of scientists studying the rabbit population on Iowa State campus. Of utmost concern is the number of rabbits taxing the campus vegetation, and you have been asked to develop a Java class that can model the population in a simple simulation. 
<p>
At its simplest, a model will have an instance variable representing the size of the population, and the population can be observed by calling a method <code>getPopulation</code>.  The passage of time is indicated by calling a method 
<code>simulateYear</code>. Each year, some rabbits are born and others die, resulting in a new population at the end of the year.

<p>
As you will see in the next step, a simple plotting tool has already been developed. It will make a chart of the population over the simulated years using your model.
</p>

<h3>Specification for <code>RabbitModel</code></h3>
The class <code>RabbitModel</code> has the following specification:

<ul>
<li>Contains a method named <code>getPopulation</code> that returns an <code>int</code> representing the number of rabbits alive at the end of the current year of the simulation. It takes no arguments.</li>
<li>Contains a method named <code>simulateYear</code> that simulates the passage of a year. This method updates the number of rabbits alive at the end of the year, and adjusts any additional state (instance variables) of the model. It takes no arguments.</li>
<li>Contains a constructor taking no arguments.</li>
<li>Contains a method named <code>reset</code> which initializes any instance variables to their values at the start of the simulation.  It takes no arguments.</li>
<li>Is in the <code>lab3</code> package.

</ul>
Based on just the description above, we can create a minimal skeleton of a <code>RabbitModel</code> with the methods and constructor stubbed in and documented.
Take a look at <a href="RabbitModel.java">RabbitModel.java</a> and add it to your <code>lab3</code> package.


<h3>Our first model</h3>
For the first example, we will create a very simple model in which
<ul>
<li>The population is initially two,
<li>one new rabbit is born each year, and
<li>no rabbits ever die.
</ul>

To implement this simple model, your class really only needs one instance variable,
representing the current population of rabbits.  
<ol>
<li>Add a private <code>int</code> instance variable to your <code>RabbitModel</code>.
<li>In the constructor, initialize this variable to 2.
<li>
In the <code>simulateYear</code>
method, increment this variable by 1 to simulate the passing
of one year.  
<li>
In the <code>reset</code> method, set this variable back to the initial value 2.
(Note that this <code>reset</code> always does the exact same work as the constructor, so in more complex models you can save yourself some effort by just calling <code>reset</code> in your constructor.)
</ol>
<p>
More generally, the <code>simulateYear</code> method could alter the population according to weather, pesticide usage, traffic, predators, butterflies in Brazil, etc. For the checkpoints, you will revise this code to create more complex models.

<h3>Unit testing the model</h3>
Before continuing, see if the model you created seems to be working correctly all by itself.  This is much easier than trying to fix errors when you're trying to <em>integrate</em> your code with an existing library or framework.
<p>
For example, you could try something like this:
<p>
<pre class="block">
public class TestModel
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    RabbitModel model = new RabbitModel();
    
    // Check that the initial population is 2
    System.out.println(model.getPopulation());
    System.out.println("Expected 2");
    
    // A year goes by...
    model.simulateYear();
    System.out.println(model.getPopulation());
    System.out.println("Expected 3");
    
    // Start over
    model.reset();
    System.out.println("Expected 2");
  }
}
</pre>


<!--
<p>
Sample code implementing this model is shown below. Go ahead and create a
<code>RabbitModel</code> class in your <code>lab3</code> package and
copy/paste this code.

<pre class="block">
package lab3;

/**
 * A RabbitModel is used to simulate the growth
 * of a population of rabbits. 
 */
public class RabbitModel
{
  /**
   * The current number of rabbits.
   */
  private int population;
  
  /**
   * Constructs a new RabbitModel.
   */
  public RabbitModel()
  {
    // set instance variables to the initial conditions
    reset();
  }  
 
  /**
   * Returns the current number of rabbits.
   * @return
   *   current rabbit population
   */
  public int getPopulation()
  {
    return population;
  }
  
  /**
   * Updates the population to simulate the
   * passing of one year.
   */
  public void simulateYear()
  {
    // in this model, the population just increases
    // by one each year
    population = population + 1;
  }
  
  /**
   * Sets or resets the state of the model to the 
   * initial conditions.
   */
  public void reset()
  {
    // in this model, we start out with two rabbits
    population = 2;
  }
}
