<h2>Unit Testing With <code>println</code></h2>

Testing is a discipline in itself. (At some point you may find yourself taking Com S 417, <em>Software Testing</em>.)  Determining whether a complex system is going to work correctly under all conditions is extremely difficult. In this course we will only focus on  <i>unit testing</i>, which is where we test 
a single component (usually a class) all by itself to ensure that it conforms to its specification.
<p>
We have seen many examples of simple unit tests.  As one example, consider the class <code>Basketball</code>.
We saw this class back in lab 2; you can review the 
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/labs/lab2/doc/lab2/Basketball.html" target="_blank">javadoc here</a>.
In order to test it, we start thinking about what should be true about
a correctly implemented basketball:
<ul>
<li>A newly constructed basketball is not dribbleable
<li>A newly constructed basketball should have the diameter it was constructed with
<li>After inflating, the basketball should be dribbleable
<li>After inflating, the basketball should still have the diameter it was constructed with
</ul>
For each such assertion we come up with, we can write a simple test case in which the
actual value we get from calling a method is printed out, 
along with the correct or "expected" value we really should get.

<pre>
public class BasketballExample
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Basketball b = new Basketball(5);
    
    // A newly constructed basketball should not be dribbleable
    System.out.println(b.isDribbleable());
    System.out.println("Expected: false");
    
    // A newly constructed basketball should have the diameter it was constructed with
    System.out.println(b.getDiameter());
    System.out.println("Expected: 5.0");
    
    // After inflating, the basketball should be dribbleable
    b.inflate();
    System.out.println(b.isDribbleable());
    System.out.println("Expected: true");
    
    // After inflating, the basketball should still have the diameter it was constructed with
    System.out.println(b.getDiameter());
    System.out.println("Expected: 5.0");
  }
}</pre>
If the <code>Basketball</code> class is implemented correctly, running this <code>main</code> method
should produce the output:

<pre>
false
Expected: false
5.0
Expected: 5.0
true
Expected: true
5.0
Expected: 5.0
</pre>

<h2>Using a test framework</h2>

With only four test cases, it is easy enough to look at the output and see whether the actual values match the expected values.
The <code>Basketball</code> class is very simple.  A more complex class may have dozens or hundreds
of test cases, and it is tedious to have to read through the output to check for correct values.

<!--
For example, many of us used a 
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/labs/lab5/TestClass.java">
test class for Assignment 1</a> that was posted on Piazza by a fellow student.
When it runs, it produces about 80 lines of text output that has to be read
carefully to see whether the classes give correct output on all the tests:

<pre class = "block">
This ticket should have 1000 cents in it, it have 1000 now.
This ticket should NOT be a discounted ticket, the discount status is false now.
This ticket should NOT be in a transit, the transit status is false now.
This ticket should return TicketUtil.INVALID_ZONE as start zone, does the return value equal to TicketUtil.INVALID_ZONE? true.
Let's begin a trip from zone 5.
Now the start zone should be 5, the actual value is 5.
This ticket should be in a transit, the transit status is true now.
...
...
</pre>
-->
<p>
Since we are programmers, we wonder: couldn't we just write a program to automatically
check the test output?  And (since we are programmers) of course the answer
is yes!  That is the idea of a <em>test framework</em>.  Instead of using
<code>System.out.println</code>, we write the test using a few special methods 
defined by the framework, 
and the framework completely automates the process of checking the
results.  In this course we use a framework called JUnit that extremely easy
to use and is nicely integrated with Eclipse.
