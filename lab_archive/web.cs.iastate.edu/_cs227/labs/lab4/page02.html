<h2>Parsing input</h2>

Reading input is harder than writing output.  For example, suppose you have the input:
<pre>
12 Monkeys
</pre>
is this supposed to be
<ol>
<li>A single string, "12 Monkeys"?
<li>The integer 12 and then the string "Monkeys"?
<li>Ten individual characters '1', '2', ' ', 'M', and so on?
</ol>
A stream of text that comes from the console or some other source has to be <em>parsed</em>.  Parsing input means separating it into individual items, or <em>tokens</em>, that you want.  The most common case is that the items 
are words or numbers separated by "whitespace" (spaces or tabs or newlines).
In this case we say that whitespace is the <em>delimiter</em> for our input.


<h3>Scanner</h3>
The best way to parse input in Java is using the class <code>Scanner</code>,
which is in the package <code>java.util</code>.
A Scanner object can be constructed to read from any stream of text - 
input typed at the console, a String, a file, or a stream of data from
an internet connection.  By default, it will treat whitespace as the delimiter (but that can be changed if, for example, your input elements are separated by commas or some other characters).

<h3>next()</h3>
The most basic method of Scanner is <code>next()</code>, which returns the next
item of input and returns it as a String.  Try this example, which 
reads three words from a string. 

<pre class="block">
package lab4;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    String theInput = "Huey Louie Dewey";
    
    // construct a scanner to read from the string
    Scanner in = new Scanner(theInput);
    
    // parse the input to get the three items
    String first = in.next();
    String second = in.next();
    String third = in.next();
    
    // print them out
    System.out.println(first);
    System.out.println(second);
    System.out.println(third);
  }
}
</pre>

Create a class <code>ScannerTest</code> in your lab4 package and paste in the code above.
Notice there is a compile error, since we are trying to use the <code>Scanner</code> class without an import statement.  
Here is a nice trick in Eclipse for fixing up missing import statements: put the cursor anywhere in the editor window, and hit Control-Shift-O.  You should see the import statement for <code>java.util.Scanner</code> appear after the <code>package</code> statement.
<p>
(You'll also see a yellow "warning" marker in the code suggesting that you 
close the Scanner.  That will be important in the future when we read from files,
but is meaningless for reading from a string or from the console.)
<p>
There is an important thing to notice.  <strong>Each time you make a call to <code>next()</code>,
<em>you get a different value</em>.</strong>  There is no way to back up and read the same item again.  Internally the Scanner has a marker or "cursor" that moves forward through 
the input as it is read.

<h3>Reading from the console</h3>
Corresponding to the standard output stream <code>System.out</code> there is 
an input stream called <code>System.in</code> for input that you type
in the console window.
A Scanner can be constructed to read from System.in.  The main difference
between reading from the console and reading from other kinds of input is
that when you call <code>next()</code>, <em>the program will stop and wait for you ty
type something.</em> 

<p>
Try this example in Eclipse.  After it starts, click in the console
window and type some words, then press the Enter key.
<pre class="block">
package lab4;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTest2
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    // construct a scanner to read from the console
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    // print a "prompt" so the user knows why the program is waiting
    System.out.print("Enter three words separated by spaces: ");
    
    // parse the input to get the three items
    String first = in.next();
    String second = in.next();
    String third = in.next();
    
    // print them out
    System.out.println(first);
    System.out.println(second);
    System.out.println(third);
  }
}
</pre>
