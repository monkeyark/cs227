<h1>Conditional statements</h1>

In this section you will practice a bit with the idea of conditional logic and writing code that uses conditionals.  We will create a short interactive application for calculating postage.

<p>
The U.S. Postal Service has some complex rules for deciding how much it costs to mail a letter. For this project we'll use a small part of these rules.  

<p>
For an ordinary letter up to 3.5 ounces, the cost is .47 plus .21 for each additional ounce (or part of an ounce). Try some examples: 

<ul>
<li>A letter that is 1 ounce (or less) is just .47. 
<li>For a 3 ounce letter the cost is .47 + (2 * .21) = .89 
<li>For a 2.3 ounce letter, the cost is also .47 + (2 * .21) = .89, since 1.3 rounds up to 2
<li>For a 3.1 ounce letter the cost is .47 + (3 * .21) = 1.10, since 2.1 rounds up to 3
</li>

To translate this into code, it would be nice to have a slick way to take a float value and round "up" to the next whole number. Fortunately there is a function in the Math class, called ceil() (short for “ceiling”) that does exactly what we want. Try executing these statements:

<pre class="block">
package lab4;

    public class CeilingTest
    {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        System.out.println(Math.ceil(1.3));
        System.out.println(Math.ceil(2.0));
        System.out.println(Math.ceil(2.1));
        System.out.println(Math.ceil(-2.1));
      }
    }
</pre>

Now, to make things more interesting, let's add the rule for letters over 3.5 ounces: the cost is .94 plus .21 for each additional ounce (or part of an ounce). 
<p>
For example, 
<ul>
<li>a 3.5 ounce letter would cost .47 + (3 * .21) = 1.10, using the first rule
<li>a 3.8 ounce letter would cost .94 + (3 * .21) = 1.57 
<li>a 10 ounce letter would cost .94 + (9 * .21) = 2.83 
</ul>
Notice you have to check the actual weight to see if it is bigger than 3.5, but then round up when you calculate the extra ounces.
