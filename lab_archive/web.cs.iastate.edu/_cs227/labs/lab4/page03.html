<h3>Reading numbers</h3>

The value returned by next() is always of type String. But if you are working with numbers, that's not very convenient, because you can't do math with Strings.  
<p>
In the last lab, you saw how to use a method such as <code>Integer.parseInt</code>
to convert a string to an integer. 
The <code>Scanner</code>
class provides additional methods that are specialized for reading different types of values: <code>nextInt()</code> for reading integers and <code>nextDouble()</code> for reading floating-point values.  For example, here is a simple main class that reads two integers from the keyboard and prints their product:

<pre class="block">
package lab4;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Multiplier
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    int first = scanner.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    int second = scanner.nextInt();
    int result = first * second;
    System.out.println(first + " times " + second + " is " + result);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Create the <code>Multiplier</code> class in Eclipse and run it.
<p>

<!--
<h3>Using a helper method</h3>
Notice that the task of prompting the user and reading the next number happens more than once.  This is an opportunity to use a <em>helper method</em>.  We can take the 
repeated statements and move them into a separate method whose job is simply to 
prompt the user and return the next number that is typed.  Then that method can be called
from <code>main</code>:

<pre class="block">
public class Multiplier
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    // Create one scanner to read from System.in
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
	
    // Use the helper method to prompt and return the inputs
    int first = getNextNumber(scanner);
    int second = getNextNumber(scanner);
	
    int result = first * second;
    System.out.println(first + " times " + second + " is " + result);
  }
  
  // Helper method
  private static int getNextNumber(Scanner scanner)
  {
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    int next = scanner.nextInt();
    return next;
  }
}
</pre>

The helper method is made <code>private</code>, since we only 
expect it to be used within this class.  It has to be declared <code>static</code>
in order to be called from <code>main</code>.  (The <code>static</code> keyword
can be confusing.  Basically it just means that the method doesn't need to refer
to any instance variables, so it can be called directly from <code>main</code>
without creating any objects.)

<p> 
Notice also that the helper method has a 
<code>Scanner</code> as a parameter. When reading from <code>System.in</code>
we should only create one scanner, so we create it in <code>main</code> and pass
it as an argument to the helper method.
<p>
Replace the code for your <code>Multiplier</code> class with the version
above and try it out.  (In this example, the helper method only saves us a few lines of code.  In more realistic examples, you'll find the helper method much more of a "help".)
