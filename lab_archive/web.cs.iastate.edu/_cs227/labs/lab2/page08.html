<h2>Generating HTML</h2>
The JDK includes a tool that will convert the specially formatted comments into html pages like the online Java API documentation.  We can run it easily from Eclipse.
<ol>

<li>Highlight the "project2" project, go to the Project menu, and run <code>Generate Javadoc...</code>. A dialog appears.
Most of the default settings are fine, but check the next three items.

<li>The project2 project should be checked.  
<li>The "Javadoc command:" field should contain a path to a utility called javadoc.exe, similar to the following:
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_144\bin\javadoc.exe
</pre>


<strong>If you don't see a path like the one above</strong> (the exact version numbers may vary), click the <code>Configure</code> button and navigate to the javadoc
executable <code>javadoc.exe</code>.  To find the <code>Program Files</code> directory,
you may need to click on "This PC" in the sidebar and then "Local Disk (C:)"
If you are not sure, feel free to ask your TA to help you find the correct path. Then click Finish.

What if it doesn't?

<div class="expandableContent">
<ul>
<li>Click the <code>Configure</code> button and navigate to the javadoc
executable, <code>javadoc.exe</code>.  Normally the path will be
similar to the following:

If you are not sure, feel free to ask your TA to help you find the correct path. Then click Finish.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
-->

<li>In the "Destination" field, make sure you see an <em>absolute path</em> into your
your workspace, beginning with the drive letter you have mapped; it should be similar to:
<pre class="block">
U:\cs227\workspace\project2\lab2\doc
</pre>
depending on exactly how you named your workspace directory.
<em>If you see a network path starting with "<code>\\cyfiles.iastate.edu...</code>" or something like that, change it to an absolute path starting with a drive letter.</em>
<li>If necessary, confirm in the next dialog that a "doc" directory may be
written to in your project.
<li>After the javadoc tool runs (it will produce some console output) a webpage containing the documentation is created inside your project folder.  You can expand the directory <code>doc</code> in the Package Explorer and right-click on <code>index.html</code> to view the page in a web browser within Eclipse.  (If you'd prefer to use a traditional web browser, open the file through  File Explorer.)  Nice, huh?

<!--
<ul>
<li>Note: if you only see an empty 'doc' directory in your project, it 
is probably because your workspace is located under a symbolic directory
such as "Documents" or "Desktop".  We recommend that you set up a workspace
using an absolute path on a mapped drive, such as <code>U:\cs227\workspace</code>,
as <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/labs/lab1/page08.html">
described in lab 1</a>.
</ul>
-->

</ol>

<p>
Compare the generated webpage to the documentation in the source code.  
Try making some changes and see where the changes appear in the html.
What effect do the <code>@return</code> and <code>@param</code> have? 

<p>
If you have trouble, your TA is there to help.
</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid #ff0000; right-margin:1.0in"> 
In the homework assignments, a portion of the points will be designated for writing  Javadoc-style comments as in the previous example.  (We <em>don't</em> require you to generate html for homework submission.)
