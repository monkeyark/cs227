<h2>Writing a Class</h2>

<p>
Writing your own class is like writing a recipe.  You define a collection of ingredients (the <i>attributes</i> or <i>state</i>) and a set of instructions (<i>methods</i> or <i>operations</i>) for working with the ingredients. Once written, your recipe can be used by others to make instances of your delicacy.
</p>

<p>
One nuance that is sometimes hard to appreciate is that, while writing your recipe, you are not actually baking anything. You are only describing how a recipe is to hypothetically be baked. Someone else must come along and use your recipe (make instances of your class). That someone else may be you, or it may be a coworker, or it may be someone that you don't even know.

<h3>Modeling a Basketball</h3>

<p>
Say we work for a basketball manufacturer and we want to simulate production of basketballs for quality assurance purposes. Now, a real
basketball might have a lot of attributes - a color, a rubbery smell, 
fingerprints, air pressure, and so on. For our simple software model
of a basketball, we choose to worry only about two attributes:
<ul>
<li>What is the basketball's <em>diameter</em>?
<li>Is the basketball <em>inflated</em> or not?
</ul>

So we have defined a class called <code>Basketball</code> that has these two 
attributes, along with some operations, or <em>methods</em>, for examining
or updating them.
<p>
Let's start by looking at how one of these <code>Basketball</code> objects might be used, and then we'll look carefully at the code.
