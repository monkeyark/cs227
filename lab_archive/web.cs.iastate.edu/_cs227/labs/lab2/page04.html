<h2>Java API</h2>

<p>
How did we know about the <code>length</code> method and how to use it? Well, the individuals who wrote the <code>String</code> class also published documentation on how the class may be used.  In the documentation, they describe the <i>API</i> ("Application Programmer Interface") of the String class, which tells how <code>String</code>s are constructed and what methods are available to our <code>String</code> instances.
</p>

<p>
Follow the link below and find the description of the class <code>String</code> in the Java API
documentation (search for the package "java.lang" in the list at the top left, and then scroll through the classes).

<p class="block">
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/" target="New_Win">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/</a>
</p>
<p>
Start by scrolling down from the top of the documention page.  Note there is some description, then a section "Field Summary", followed by "Constructor Summary", and finally, "Method Summary".  The method summaries are always one-sentence descriptions of what the methods do.  Click on the method name -- a link takes you to a more detailed description.  Use the Back button to return.

<p>
Locate the description of the <code>length</code> method.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, <code>String</code> is not simple. You do not need to memorize any part of this documentation. However, you will refer to it frequently throughout your time as a Java programmer.  There is a huge amount of information here, and many things that don't yet make any sense to us.  Do not worry -- we don't have to understand it all now.
</p>

<h3>Other Methods</h3>

<p>
Let's explore other methods of the <code>String</code> class. 
Look for a method named <code>charAt</code>, which returns a single character
from the string.  Read its detailed description (ignoring details that don't make any sense yet).  

<p>
<img src="javadoc_screenshot.jpg" width=640 alt="Screenshot of Javadoc for charAt() method" />

<p>
In particular look at the first line as shown above. 
<ul>
<li>The method has a parameter <code>index</code> of type <code>int</code>. In order for <code>charAt</code> to perform its job you must specify an integer <i>argument</i> 
corresponding to this parameter.  Below, the "Parameters" section provides a brief description of what it means.  In this case, the argument indicates the position of the character you'd like to inspect. (The positions are numbered from the left, starting at zero.)
<li>The method has a <em>return value</em> of type <code>char</code>.  This is the result we'll get when calling the method.  Below, the "Returns" section provides a brief description.
</ul>
<p>
Add the following to your code:
</p>

<pre class="block">
char theChar = message.charAt(0);
System.out.println(theChar);

theChar = message.charAt(1);
System.out.println(theChar);
</pre>

Try some other arguments besides 0 and 1.  What is the largest index you can use without getting an error?
