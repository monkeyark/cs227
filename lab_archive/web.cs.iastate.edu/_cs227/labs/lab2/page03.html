<h2>Class 101</h2>

<!--p>
A key advantage of organizing code into classes is the ability to program at a higher level. Instead of getting caught up in low-level manipulation of primitives, we <i>abstract</i> away operations into higher-level objects.
</p-->

<p>
Java has 8 primitive types such as <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>boolean</code> for numbers and simple true/false values.  Everything else
is some kind of <em>object</em>.  The definition for an object type is called a 
<em>class</em>.

<p>
Java provides a number of predefined classes: we have used <code>System</code> to access the standard output stream and we have also seen the <code>String</code> class for text.
As with the primitive data types, you must declare a variable of a class in order to use it:
</p>

<pre class="block">
String message;
</pre>

<p>
Also, just as with primitives, you must initialize the variable.  A variable whose type is a class can store a reference to an object which is an <em>instance</em> of that class.  In the case of <code>String</code>, it is easy to construct a new instance: we can just put some text in quotes:

<pre class="block">
message = "Hello, world!";
System.out.println(message);
</pre>

<!--
However, in this case, the initialization is not as simple, since the class may contain a number of primitives that must be initialized. Thankfully, the details of this initialization are hidden away inside the class, and you need only invoke the <i>constructor</i> of the class.
-->


<!--p>
The right-hand side of the assignment instructs the computer to reserve space in memory for whatever data a <code>String</code> needs to store. (Ask yourself, "What data does a <code>String</code> need to store?") That memory is then filled according to the constructor of the class, and you now have an <i>instance</i> of the <code>String</code> class which you can refer to. You will write your own constructor later in this lab.
</p-->

<h3>Invoking methods</h3>

<p>
Most classes also define operations, called <em>methods</em>, that allow you to examine or modify the data in each instance. 
You can <em>invoke</em> or <em>call</em> a method using the dot operator on an instance of the class.
<p>
For example, the class <code>String</code> has many methods available. A commonly used method is <code>length</code>, which retrieves the length of a string. 
</p>

<pre class="block">
int theLength = message.length();
System.out.println(theLength);
</pre>

<p>
In your <code>lab2</code> package, write a class named <code>StringTest</code> with a <code>main</code> method to try this out.  Consult the <a href="../lab1/page10.html">previous lab</a> if you do not remember to how create a class and <code>main</code> method. Run it and inspect the output.
