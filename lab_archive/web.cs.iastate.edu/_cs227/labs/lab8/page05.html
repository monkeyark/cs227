<h2>The File Class</h2>

<p>
The Java libraries provide a class called 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html" target="New_Win"><code>File</code></a>
that represents an abstract file name and path. It has methods for examining
and modifying the properties of files and directories. Some useful methods of the 
<code>File</code> class are illustrated in the snippet below.

</p> 

<pre class="block">
    File file = new File("story.txt");
    System.out.println(file.exists());          // true if the file exists
    System.out.println(file.getName());         // name of the file 
    System.out.println(file.getAbsolutePath()); // absolute path to the file
    System.out.println(file.length());          // size of the file
</pre>

Try adding the lines above to your <code>main</code> method and see what 
the output is.

<!--You can also construct a <code>Scanner</code> directly from a <code>File</code>
object:

<pre class="block">
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);
</pre>
-->

<h3>Using a relative or absolute path to a file</h3>
When you run your code from Eclipse, it treats the project directory as the "working directory" for the program.  If you are trying to read a file and you don't have the file in the project directory, you can still get to it using an absolute or relative path.  For example, suppose your project directory is <code>U:\cs227\workspace\project8</code> but the file "story.txt" is 
located in <code>U:\cs227\stuff\</code>, as shown:
<p>
<img src="filetree1.jpg" width="690" />
<p>


You can specify the file's location as an
<em>absolute path</em>, starting from the root of the filesystem: 

<pre class="block">
File file = new File("U:/cs227/stuff/story.txt");
</pre>

<p>
It is often simpler and more reliable to use a <em>relative</em> path. Use the string ".." (two dots) to mean,
"go up to the parent directory."  In the illustration above, to get from the <code>project8</code> directory
to the file <code>story.txt</code> you describe the directions as follows:
<ol>
<li>Go up one level to the <code>workspace</code> directory.
<li>Go up one level to the <code>cs227</code> directory.
<li>Go down into the <code>stuff</code> directory.
<li>Open the file <code>story.txt</code>.
</ol>
(Follow the red arrows in the illustration.) As a path, this is written,
<pre class="block">
File file = new File("../../stuff/story.txt");
</pre>

<h3>File paths in Java strings</h3>
Note that even though Windows always uses backslashes (<code>\</code>) for the path separator character, Java allows you to use either backslashes (<code>\</code>) or forward slashes (<code>/</code>).  The catch is that if you want a backslash character in a Java string, <em>you have to type two backslashes</em>.  (The backslash character already has a special meaning in Java strings, so when you really want a backslash, you have to write "backslash backslash".)  So the absolute path would look like this:

<pre class="block">
File file = new File("U:\\cs227\\stuff\\story.txt");
</pre>
and the relative path would look like this:
<pre class="block">
File file = new File("..\\..\\stuff\\story.txt");
</pre>
