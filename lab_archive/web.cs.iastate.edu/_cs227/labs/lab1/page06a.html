<h2>Backups</h2>


<p>
All of your work for this course must be stored in a reliable location, that is, on a network server that is securely maintained.  

<ul>
<li> <strong>Do not ever store anything on the local hard drives of the lab machines</strong> (e.g. on the "C:" drive).  These locations may be seen by other people (a violation of the academic dishonesty policy) and moreover may be erased by the SSG staff at any time.
<li> A USB drive, or your laptop or home computer's hard drive, is <em>not</em> a reliable location.  Even if you exclusively use your own computer for course work, you are expected to back up your work on a university network server.  The following are examples of actual excuses that students have attempted to give for missing an assignment deadline:
<p>
<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>"I left my laptop at the Chicago airport"
<li>"My hard drive crashed"
<li>"My computer completely died this weekend and I lost all my files"
<li>"My screen just went dead and I had to take my laptop to Best Buy to get it fixed"
<li>"I bumped my USB drive with my knee and broke it off"
<li>"My flash drive was on the floor and got crushed when I rolled my chair back"
</ul>
<br>
The instructor's response in all cases was, "Surely, you had your work backed up on the server!!"
</ul>

<p>
If you are using your own computer for this lab you will still need to back up files on network storage. See the "Working Remotely" page at the end of this lab for some tips on how to do this.
