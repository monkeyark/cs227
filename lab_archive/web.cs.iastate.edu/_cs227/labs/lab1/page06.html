<h2>Network Storage</h2>

When you're working in the lab, you should not store anything on the local hard drive of the lab computer.  Why not?  
<ul>
<li>Next time you come to the lab, you might not get that machine.  
<li>You might want to access your files from home or another location.
<li>The IT staff can delete user files at any time during system maintenance.  
<li>And you don't want other people to have access to your work.
</ul>

Even if you are doing all the work on your own computer, you need to have your worked backed up in a secure location.

<!--
<h3>The network storage formerly known as CyFiles</h3>
<em>Disclaimer: It was only about two weeks ago that ISU's IT department changed over all the network storage that we formerly used for this course.  The information here is believed to be correct, but there always seem to be unforseen issues during system changes.  Please be patient as things get sorted out.</em>
-->

<h3>MyFiles</h3>
One simple solution is to keep your work on the ISU-managed network storage called "MyFiles", formerly known as "CyFiles". This way, your workspace will look the same from any of the lab computers.  There are also some options for accessing the files from outside the lab; see the "Working Remotely" page at the end of this document.

<p>
When you log into a lab machine, your MyFiles storage should automatically be "mapped" to drive letter <code>U:</code>. Do this now:
<ol>
<li>Open up the Windows <em>File Explorer</em> using the icon at the bottom of the screen that looks like a file folder, or using the Start menu.  
<li>Click "This PC" on the left sidebar (see screenshot below).
<li>Double click on the <code>U:</code> drive at the bottom under "Network locations" (should look <em>similar</em> to the screenshot below).
</ol>

<h3>Other options</h3>
<h4>Using your Com S account</h4>
The Com S department has some servers of its own to which you have access as a student in this course.  You can map your space on the CS servers as a drive letter or as a shared folder on a Mac, use an sftp client such as FileZilla, or interact directly with the system via a command shell.  See the SSG page
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/how-access-your-files-cs-file-server" target=_blank>
http://www.cs.iastate.edu/how-access-your-files-cs-file-server</a> for information on how to do this.
-->

<h4>If your MyFiles isn't automatically mapped</h4>
Follow the instructions here in the SSG FAQ:
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/how-access-your-files-through-samba-server" target=_blank>
http://www.cs.iastate.edu/how-access-your-files-through-samba-server</a>, using the network path:
<pre>
\\my.files.iastate.edu\Users\<em>yournetid</em>
</pre>
<br>
where <em>yournetid</em> is replaced with your ISU NetID.
<p>

<h4>Using some other mapped network drive</h4>
If you already have network storage provided to you by CS or another department, you can certainly use it for this course.
For example, students in Engineering will normally have network storage
automatically mapped as a drive letter when they log into the
Pearson machines.  You can certainly use that if you prefer.  Options for remote access
described at the end of this lab may vary; check with your department.
<p>
Where the lab instructions refers to a drive letter <code>U:</code>, 
be sure to substitute
the letter you actually have mapped.

<h4>Using your own computer</h4>
Follow the instructions for remote access to MyFiles on the last page of this lab. (If 
you are using a Mac, of course, you won't have a drive letter,
but you'll see your storage in Finder as a shared device.)

<h3>My Documents: just say no</h3>
Do not use the symbolic directories such as "My Documents" or "Desktop" for your work. Instead, set up a workspace on a network server using an absolute path as described later in "Creating a Workspace".
