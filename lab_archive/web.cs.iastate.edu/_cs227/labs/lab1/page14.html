<h2>Submitting an Assignment or Miniassignment</h2>

All homework is submitted on Blackboard by attaching a zip archive of your Java source files.
For miniassignments, the zip file is created by the SpecChecker.  For regular assignments, 
you may need to create the zip file yourself.  
<p>
The document
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/submission.pdf" target=_blank>
"Assignment Submission HOWTO"</a> 
describes in detail how to submit an assignment to Blackboard, 
how to check that the submission was correct, and also how to create a zip file of your Java project when necessary.
<p>
Take a look at the first section of that document now.  Follow the instructions
to submit your zip file (created by the SpecChecker on the previous page) on Blackboard as "Lab 1 practice submission". 
<p>
Log into Blackboard at <a href="https://bb.its.iastate.edu/" target=_blank>https://bb.its.iastate.edu</a> using your ISU NetID and password. 
You can find the "Lab 1 practice submission" link on Blackboard on the "Homework" page for Com S 227.

<h3>Checkpoint 3</h3>

<ol>
<li>Show the TA your Submission History Page on Blackboard for "Lab 1 practice submission" with the uploaded zip file.
<li>Demonstrate that you can download the zip file into a temporary directory, and open it to examine its contents (in Windows you can normally just double-click on it).
There should be one directory called "lab1" 
with one file called "Greeter.java". 
</ol>
