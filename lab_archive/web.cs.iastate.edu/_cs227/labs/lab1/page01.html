<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
This weekly lab is a required component of Computer Science 227. 
The purpose of the lab is to give you a chance to try things hands-on, in 
a smaller group than the lectures, where there are people around to talk to and a TA present to answer questions.  The topics presented in the lab will generally follow along with the lectures.
<!--
<h3>Working together in lab</h3>
While working during the scheduled lab period, you are encouraged to <strong>work together and discuss things with the people next to you</strong>.  Of course, you'll each have to complete the checkpoints individually, but the lab period is a good time to try things and ask questions.
-->

<h3>Goals for today</h3>
There isn't much about programming as such just yet.  In today's lab, we want to make sure you can:

<ul>
<li>Create and use a workspace on an ISU-managed network server
<li>Find your files again when you need to submit an assignment
<li>Create and run a simple Java program using the Eclipse development environment
<li>Run a tool called the SpecChecker that will help to validate your assignments for this course
<li>Submit an assignment on Blackboard and verify that it was correctly uploaded
</ul>


<h3>Your first task</h3>
In order for the TA to record your lab scores, you'll need to sign up for the 
appropriate "group" on Blackboard.  

<ol>
<li>First, make sure you know your lab section number.  It is on your schedule of classes.  You can look it up 
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/syllabus.html" target=_blank>
in the TA list in the syllabus</a>
if you don't know.
<li>Next, sign in to Blackboard, go to Com S 227, and click on "Groups" in the menu on the left side.
<li>Click on "View Sign-up Sheet" and join the group corresponding to your lab section number.  
</ol>
