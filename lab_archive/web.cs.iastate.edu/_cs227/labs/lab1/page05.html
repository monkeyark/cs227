<h2>Where Are My Files?</h2>

When you are using Microsoft Word to write an essay on your home computer, and you click "Save", it is usually OK to let Word store the file in some default location such as a "My Documents" folder.  But in a programming course, that won't work. 
<ul>
<li>
For one thing, an assignment may have multiple files that you'll need to find and package up into a complete submission.  You are going to need to know <em>exactly</em> where those files are stored.  
<li>
When working in a public computer lab like this, you have to be careful NOT to store anything on the local hard drive of the lab computer you're using.  Next time you come to the lab, you might not get that machine.  The IT staff can delete user files at any time during system upgrades.  And you don't want other people to have access to your work.
</ul>

<p>This portion of the lab has the following three objectives:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you can create a workspace in a network location that you can use during labs.
<li>Make sure you can back up your work on a network server.
<li>Make sure you can always find and identify your files.
</ul>


<h3>Devices and Filesystems</h3>

<p>
Files are stored on devices such as hard disk drives, flash drives, CDs and DVDs.  These may be physically connected to the computer you're using, or they may be accessed through a network.
<p>
On Windows operating systems, each device is identified by a single letter of the alphabet. For instance, the <code>C:</code> drive is typically the main internal hard drive of a machine.  (<code>A:</code> and <code>B:</code> were historically reserved for floppy disks.)  As you insert flash drives or CDs, they are normally assigned the next available drive letter, perhaps <code>D:</code> or <code>E:</code>. Devices on a network can also be mapped to a drive letter. 
<p>
Each device starts with a <i>root</i> directory within which all other files and subdirectories on the drive reside. (Directories are also called "folders.") When we view this root directory using the operating system, the filesystem appears as an organized hierarchy, or tree-like structure. Each file stored in this hierarchy is identified by its <i>path</i>. For instance, the path to the file <code>Greeter.java</code> that you will create in this lab might be 
</p>
<p>
<code>U:\cs227\workspace\project1\src\lab1\Greeter.java</code>
</p>

<p>
(The root directory on Linux and Macintosh OS X is simply a forward slash<code>/</code>, and just like web addresses, paths are specified with forward-slashes instead of backward-slashes, e.g., on a Mac the path to <code>Greeter.java</code> could look like: <code>/Users/username/Documents/workspace/project1/src/lab1/Greeter.java</code>).
