<h2>Lab Logistics and Grading</h2>

<ul class="addSpace">
<li><strong>Attendance and participation in labs is required</strong>.  "Attendance" means that you come at the beginning of your scheduled lab period and work on the lab material until either you finish the checkpoints or the period ends.

<li>Each lab is like a self-paced tutorial with things for you to do.  There are occasional 
"checkpoints" which are tasks you have to show or explain to the TA.  This is how we grade your participation in lab.

<li>At the beginning of each lab period, you can find the lab writeup through the links 
on Piazza and start reading it.  The TA will normally go over the new lab and help 
everyone get started as necessary.

<li>If you finish early, you can take off, or stick around to help other people out and chat with the TA.
</ul>

<h3>Grading of lab work</h3>
<ul class="addSpace">

<li>Lab scores count for 8% of your final grade (so an individual lab counts for less than 1%).  <em>However, doing the labs is strongly correlated with higher scores on exams and homework, so that should be an even better motivation!</em>
<li><strong>If you do not attend your scheduled lab period <em>for any reason</em>, you get a zero for that lab.</strong>  You do not need to provide excuses of any kind, we do not want them.
<ul>
<li>There are normally ten or eleven labs altogether, and <strong>you can miss two of them without penalty</strong> (i.e., we will drop your lowest two scores).  You can get the flu, oversleep, travel with the ROTC, perform in a play, or attend a family reunion.  Choose wisely.
<li>If you have an extended illness or other unusual circumstances requiring you to miss classes for several weeks, please discuss the situation with your professor.
</ul>

<li>If you aren't able to finish the checkpoints within the lab period,  you have <em>6 days</em> to finish it on your own. You can meet 
with any TA during office hours to have your checkpoints recorded or get additional help. 
<strong>Late checkpoints will not be recorded more than 6 days after your lab period.
</strong>
The deadline is the last TA office hour on that 6th day.
Checkpoints will normally NOT be reviewed by email.
<li><strong>Checkpoints will not be recorded if you did not attend the lab in the first place.
</strong>  
</ul>
<h3>Working together</h3>
While working during the scheduled lab period, you are encouraged to <strong>work together and discuss things with the people next to you</strong> as well as to talk with the TA.
You'll eventually have to complete the checkpoints individually, but the lab period is a good time to try things and ask questions.
If you are working on it outside of the lab period, collaboration is NOT allowed (of course, you can meet with any of the TAs during office hours for help).

<h3>Working ahead</h3>
If you prefer to start the lab ahead of time on your own, that is fine!  The lab writeup is posted sometime during the beginning of each week.  Just remember that the attendance rule still applies: you need to come at the beginning of your scheduled lab period to have the checkpoints reviewed by your TA.

<!--
<p>
We don't normally take attendance, but you will be graded on completion of the exercises labeled as "Checkpoints".  Lab scores will count for approximately 10% of 
your overall course grade.  Since each lab's checkpoints count for less than one percent of your overall grade, we hope you will 
gain something from the experience of doing the labs, without stressing out too much over
the scores.

<p>
If you finish all the checkpoints early, you may leave lab early, stay and help other 
people out, work on other things, talk to the TA about homework, etc. If you don't finish...
<p>

<h3>The six-day rule</h3>
If you are unable to complete all checkpoints during the two hours, or if you miss a lab for any reason, you will have to finish the lab on your own and show the remaining checkpoints to one of the TAs (or instructors)
<strong>within six days</strong>.  
<p>
You can visit any TA during 
office hours during the week.   <strong>No checkpoints will be recorded after the last TA office hour on the day before your next lab meeting.</strong>


 
<h3>Working together in lab</h3>
While working during the scheduled lab period, you are encouraged to work together and discuss things with the people next to you, as long as you eventually complete the checkpoints yourself. However, note that
<em>collaboration is not allowed if you 
doing the lab exercises outside of the scheduled lab period</em>.  In that case you are expected to do the work 
completely on your own (though you can see the TAs during office hours if you need help).
