<h2>Creating a Workspace</h2>

<p><em>Note: in the steps that follow, we assume that you have a network storage location mapped as a drive letter.  We'll refer to this location as U:, but use whichever letter you actually have assigned for it.</em>
 
<p>
First, create a location for your Eclipse workspace.  This is just a directory in which Eclipse will organize your Java projects and files and will keep track of various settings.
<ol>
<li>First make a directory <code>U:\cs227</code>.  (E.g., go to your <code>U:</code> drive in File Explorer, right-click, and select New...Folder.)
<li>Then within that directory, create a directory called <code>workspace</code>
</ol>

<p>
Next, start Eclipse.  In the lab machines, you can just search for "eclipse".  If you are using your own machine, you may want to create a shortcut to the executable file <code>eclipse.exe</code> located in the eclipse/bin directory.  On a Mac, look for the file called <code>Eclipse.app</code>.
<ol>
<li>Double-click the icon or shortcut to start Eclipse.  (If a dialog appears asking you to confirm that you want to run the executable, select Run.)</li>
<li>Eclipse brings a dialog asking for a workspace location. Usually there is a default value filled in.   <strong>This default location is probably on the C: drive and should not be used if you are in lab.</strong>
<li>For the workspace location, type in the absolute path for the <code>workspace</code> directory you created earlier:
<pre>
U:\cs227\workspace
</pre>
<li>After Eclipse starts, click on the X on the tab to get rid of the welcome screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The next time you start Eclipse, the same dialog will come up asking you for
a workspace location, and you'll find that a default value 
has been filled in. 
such as <code>U:\cs227\workspace</code> will already be filled in.  In most cases this is just fine,
but remember one thing: If you 
map your network storage using a different drive letter the next time
you work in the lab, you'll need to retype the workspace location using the new drive letter when you start Eclipse.

<p>
The next few simple exercises will acquaint you with the basics of creating a Java class in Eclipse.
