<h2>Subtypes and Polymorphism</h2>

<h3>Subtyping through interfaces</h3>
<p>
We'll start with a brief review of interfaces.
<p>
Suppose you were writing a video game.  You might start out with a <code>Hero</code>.
A <code>Hero</code> has a weapon in each hand and blazes through the universe 
fighting bad guys.  Maybe the code looks like this:
<pre class="block">
public class Hero {

  private Weapon rightWeapon;
  private Weapon leftWeapon;

  ...

  public void pickUpLeft(Weapon newWeapon) {
    leftWeapon = newWeapon;
  }

  public void pickUpRight(Weapon newWeapon) {
    rightWeapon = newWeapon;
  }

  public void fight() {
    rightWeapon.use();
  }

  public void fightDirty() {
    leftWeapon.use();
    rightWeapon.use();
  }
}
</pre>

A <code>Hero</code> fights the bad guys by <em>using</em> one or both weapons.
But what is a <code>Weapon</code>?  We might need lots of different kinds:
Howitzers, Wet Noodles, Killer Sheep, Ice Swords, and so on. 

<!--Well, here are a couple of 
ways to handle this.
<ol>
<li>We could define a different <code>Hero</code> class for each possible combination of weapons:
<pre>
public class NoodleFlingingSwordWieldingHero {

  private WetNoodle rightWeapon;
  private IceSword leftWeapon;
  
</pre>
and so on.  Complicated!
-->

We could define a <code>Weapon</code> class with a gigantic conditional statement:
<pre>
public class Weapon
{
  private static final int HOWITZER = 0;
  private static final int WET_NOODLE = 1;
  private static final int KILLER_SHEEP = 2;

  // etc.
  
  private int weaponType;
  
  public void use()
  {
    if (weaponType == HOWITZER)
    {
      System.out.println("KABLOOIE");
    }
    else if (weaponType == WET_NOODLE)
    {
      System.out.println("fling swat swat");
    }
    else if (weaponType == KILLER_SHEEP)
    {
      System.out.println("Baaaaaa!");
    }
    // ... and so on
	
  }
}
</pre>
But this is ugly and is problematic.  The problems show up later when you
dream up 5 new kinds of weapons, and you have to go back and modify the code,
<em>which you have already spent precious time testing and debugging</em>.

The solution is to use an <em>interface</em>.  All that the <code>Hero</code>
class needs to know about any kind of weapon is that it has a <code>use()</code> method.
So we define <code>Weapon</code> as an interface that specifies that one method.

<pre class="block">
public interface Weapon 
{
   public void use();
}
</pre>

Notice that in the interface, there is no method body - we only specify 
that the method exists and has no parameters and returns void.
Now we can define some types of <code>Weapon</code>s:


<pre class="block">
public class Howitzer implements Weapon {
  public void use() {
    System.out.println("KABLOOIE");
  }
}

public class WetNoodle implements Weapon {
  public void use() {
    System.out.println("fling swat swat");
  }
}

public class KillerSheep implements Weapon {
  public void use() {
    System.out.println("Baaaaaa!");
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Each of these classes is a <em>subtype</em> of <code>Weapon</code>.  
A variable of type <code>Weapon</code> can refer to any of its subtypes.
For example, the variables <code>leftWeapon</code> and <code>rightWeapon</code>
in the <code>Hero</code> class can refer to <em>any</em> object that implements
the <code>Weapon</code> interface:

<pre class="block">
hero.pickUpLeft(new WetNoodle()); 
// hero fights left-handed with WetNoodle for a while
hero.fight();
// then decides to switch weapons
hero.pickUpLeft(new Howitzer());  
// now, the leftWeapon variable refers to a Howitzer
</pre>

And 6 months later, if we want to add some new kinds of weapons, we don't have to change 
<code>Hero</code> or <code>Weapon</code>.

<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
This phenomenon, that a variable of some type can actually refer to an object of any of its subtypes, is called <em>polymorphism</em>, a word meaning "many forms".  If you see only the code
<pre>
w.use();
</pre>
there is no way to know what the result will be, because the variable <code>w</code> is a kind of shape-shifter - it may have many forms, and the result of the <code>use()</code> method depends on exactly which type of <code>Weapon</code> the variable <code>w</code> is referring to <em>at the moment the code is being executed</em>.  Because of polymorphism, every variable actually has two types associated with it.
<ul>
<li>the <em>declared type</em> is the type you gave the variable when you declared it
<li>the <em>run-time type</em> is the actual type of the object that the variable refers to when the code runs.
</ul>
The declared type never changes, but the run-time type can vary as the code runs:

<pre class="block">
Weapon w;                // declared type of w is Weapon
w = new Howitzer();      // now w refers to run-time type Howitzer 
w.use();                 // prints KABLOOIE
w = new KillerSheep();   // now w refers to a KillerSheep
w.use();                 // prints Baaaaaa!
</pre>
