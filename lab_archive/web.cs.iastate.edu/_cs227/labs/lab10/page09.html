<h2>Group Portrait</h2>

<p>
We are going to compose a group "photo" which creates a programmatic drawing of everyone who completes this checkpoint. First, you are given the  
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/labs/lab10/Portrait.java">
<code>Portrait</code></a> class, which extends <code>JPanel</code>.  The <code>paintComponent</code> method just draws a stick figure.  There
are a number of parameters that adjust the relative size of the head and arms, how much the legs are spread out, and so on.  The two constructors look like this:

<pre class="block">
   /** Create a portrait with the specified body shape. */
   public Portrait(double headPercent, double neckPercent,
                   double bodyPercent, double armPercent,
                   double armRaisePercent, double spreadEaglePercent) {
      setMinimumSize(new Dimension(SIZE, SIZE));
      setPreferredSize(getMinimumSize());
      setMaximumSize(getMinimumSize());

      setHeadRadius(headPercent);
      setNeckHeight(neckPercent);
      setBodyHeight(bodyPercent);
      setArmSpan(armPercent);
      setArmRaise(armRaisePercent);
      setSpreadEagleness(spreadEaglePercent);
   }
   
   /** Create a portrait with default body shape. */
   public Portrait(double headPercent) {
      // Call sibling constructor.
      this(headPercent, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3);
   }

</pre>

You can also take a look at the <code>paintComponent</code>
method.  You can see that the code just draws a circle for the head and a bunch of lines for the body, using some methods from <code>java.awt.Graphics</code>.  (Remember, with screen graphics the point (0, 0) is
the <em>top</em> left corner of the screen, so the y-axis goes downwards.)

<pre class="block">
   @Override
   public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
      g.setColor(Color.BLACK);

      int midX = SIZE / 2;

      // Draw head.  We specify a a circle by giving the upper-left corner
      // of a box that contains it, followed by the width and height of the box
      g.drawOval(midX - headRadius, 0, headRadius * 2, headRadius * 2);

      // Draw neck.  A line is specified by two points (x1, y1, x2, y2)
      int neckTop = headRadius * 2;
      int neckBottom = neckTop + neckHeight;
      int crotch = neckTop + neckHeight + bodyHeight;
      g.drawLine(midX, neckTop, midX, crotch);

      // Draw arms.
      g.drawLine(midX, neckBottom, midX - armSpan, neckBottom + armRaise);
      g.drawLine(midX, neckBottom, midX + armSpan, neckBottom + armRaise);

      // Draw legs.
      g.drawLine(midX, crotch, midX - spreadEagleness, getHeight());
      g.drawLine(midX, crotch, midX + spreadEagleness, getHeight());
   }

</pre>
 
<p>

The class 
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/labs/lab10/GroupPhoto.java">
<code>GroupPhoto</code></a> has the main method, so you can go ahead and run it.
As in the previous example, the main method just invokes a method <code>createAndShow</code> which does all the object creation.  Here's how it starts out.

<pre class="block">
   private static void createAndShow()
   {
     ArrayList<Portrait> portraits = new ArrayList<Portrait>();
     
     // Get the Portrait0CRJ class, and then 
     // you can uncomment this line
     //portraits.add(new Portrait0CRJ());

     // Replace these lines with calls to constructors for 
     // other code you pull from Piazza
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.2));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.21));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.22));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.23));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.24));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.25));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.26));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.27));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.28));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.29));
     portraits.add(new Portrait(0.3));
     
     // Now, create the GroupPhoto from our portraits 
     JPanel panel = new GroupPhoto(portraits);  
	  
      // ...remaining code then creates a window and starts up the UI machinery
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
In short, you give <code>GroupPhoto</code> an <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>Portrait</code>s on construction.  It displays all the portraits in a scrollable window. 

<h3>Checkpoint 2</h3>
<p>
For this checkpoint, you are asked to create your own special subclass of the <code>Portrait</code> class and post it on Piazza. 

<!--
For this checkpoint, you are asked to create your own special subclass of the <code>Portrait</code> class and post it on Blackboard and Piazza.  
-->
Call your class <code>PortraitLABNUMBERINITIALS</code>, replacing <code>LABNUMBER</code> with your lab section number and <code>INITIALS</code> with your initials.  Bill Roy Dollar in lab section 9 will call his class <code>Portrait9BRD</code>.
<p>
Post your portrait class on Piazza, as a followup message, according to these instructions:
<ol>
<li>Find the post on Piazza entitled "Lab 10 Section X Portraits", where X is your
lab section number.
<li>Open the post and scroll to the bottom until you see the text box labeled
"Click to start a new followup discussion".  Click in that box.
<li>Click the button labeled "code" in the editor toolbar.
<li>Go to your editor window in Eclipse and select the entire contents of the file (Ctrl-A)
<li>Paste it into the Piazza editor, and click Submit
<li>Mark the followup as "Resolved"
</ol>

<!--
Please post your portrait on <strong>both</strong> Blackboard and Piazza:

<ul>
<li>On Blackboard under the assignment "Lab 10 portrait".  
(Just upload the java file, don't package it in a zip archive.)
</li>
<li>
On Piazza as a followup message according to these instructions:
<ol>
<li>Find the post on Piazza entitled "Lab 10 Section X Portraits", where X is your
lab section number.
<li>Open the post and scroll to the bottom until you see the text box labeled
"Click to start a new followup discussion".  Click in that box.
<li>Click the button labeled "code" in the editor toolbar.
<li>Go to your editor window in Eclipse and select the entire contents of the file (Ctrl-A)
<li>Paste it into the Piazza editor, and click Submit
<li>Mark the followup as "Resolved"
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
-->



<!--
<p>
For this checkpoint, you are asked to create your own special subclass of the <code>Portrait</code> class and post it on 
the Blackboard discussion board, under the forum "Lab 10 Portraits."  Call your class <code>PortraitLABNUMBERINITIALS</code>, replacing <code>LABNUMBER</code> with your lab number and <code>INITIALS</code> with your initials.  Bill Roy Dollar in lab section 9 will call his class <code>Portrait9BRD</code>.
-->

<p>
In honor of Chris Johnson, the original author of this lab, we'll start things off by posting his self-portrait.  Download
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs227/labs/lab10/Portrait0CRJ.java">
Portrait0CRJ.java</a> and add it to your project. 
Then add it to the group photo by uncommenting the relevant line of <code>createAndShow</code>:
</p>

<pre class="block">
portraits.add(new Portrait0CRJ());
</pre>

<p>
You can also insert classes that other students have posted on Piazza - just create a new class in your project with the correct name, and
copy/paste the code from Piazza.  When the lab is completely finished, a grand montage can be composed, which we can all hang on our fridges.
</p>

<p>
Like <code>Portrait0CRJ</code> does, you should extend the <code>Portrait</code> class. Or you could choose to take a class that someone else posted and 
create a subclass of it, but all contributions should fit into a hierarchy which has <code>Portrait</code> at its base. You can set your own body parameters and/or override <code>paintComponent</code>
to draw a face.
<p>
  In the <code>paintComponent</code> method, you can invoke the superclass version
by calling <code>super.paintComponent</code>,  and then draw new features on top of it. Or you can omit the <code>super.paintComponent</code> call altogether and draw something entirely new. Creative expression is welcomed. Use any method available in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html" target="_blank"><code>Graphics</code> class</a> to draw shapes, lines, arcs, text, and so on.
  (Please, nothing obscene!)
</p>

<p>
What's the take-home lesson here?  The <code>GroupPhoto</code> class can work with any subclass of <code>Portrait</code>. The only part that must be changed is the <code>main</code> method. And in writing your own classes, you can reuse existing classes written by others by subclassing them, without modifying their code. Any code that can work with a superclass can also work with a subclass. That's object-oriented programming for you!
